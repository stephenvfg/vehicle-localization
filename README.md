# Description

This repository contains the files for a project from the [Udacity Self Driving Car Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/self-driving-car-engineer-nanodegree--nd013). The goal of this project was to determine the location of a moving vehicle using a particle filter map and sensor data.

The project code was compiled and used in tandem with a simulator from Udacity that mapped out the vehicle's movement along with a sensor visualization and particle filter's predictions. Error values were computed simultaneously to assist in understanding the accuracy of the particle filter performance.

**Project code:**

* [Particle filter C++ implementation (particle_filter.cpp)](https://github.com/stephenvfg/vehicle-localization/blob/master/src/particle_filter.cpp)
